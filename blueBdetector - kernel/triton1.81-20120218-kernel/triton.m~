% Triton software package is used to display XWAV and WAV data from HARPs
% ARPs, and hydrophone arrays as timeseries, spectra, spectrograms and 
% LTSAs (long-term spectral averages) plots.
%
% Various tools are included to convert raw formats to XWAV, decimate 
% broad-band data, and generate LTSAs.
%
% An user-manual is included as a pdf file.
%
% Any feedback should be sent to 
% cetus@ucsd.edu
%
% New and archived versions of Triton are available at
% ftp://cetus.ucsd.edu/outbox/Triton

% subroutines to link with main during compiling 
% because these are called via 'Callback'
% note: do NOT name these with capital letters because compiler converts
% them to small letters and Callback will point to incorrect filename.
